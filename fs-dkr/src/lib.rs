//! FS-DKR is a protocol for rotation of threshold ECDSA keys.
//!
//! We use standard proactive security assumptions. The protocol will be run
//! by $n$ parties. We assume honest majority, that is, number of corruptions is
//! $t<=n/2$. The adversary is malicious, and rushing. For communication, the
//! parties have access to a broadcast channel (can be implemented via a
//! bulletin board). For threshold ECDSA, we focus on GG20 protocol, currently
//! considered state of the art and most widely deployed threshold ecdsa scheme
//! (e.g. multi-party-ecdsa, tss-lib).
//!

<h1 id="start"> Getting Started  ðŸŽ‰ </h1>

This is an implementation of the threshold ECDSA signature multi-party-computation from [UC Non-Interactive, Proactive, Threshold ECDSA with Identifiable Aborts](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060) with slight modifications. We implement this MPC using the key generation protocol originally from [GG20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540) and implemented by [Zengo](https://github.com/ZenGo-X) in [multi-party-ecdsa](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/multi-party-ecdsa).

For the key refresh protocol we opt for a fork of Zengo's [fs-dkr](https://github.com/webb-tools/fs-dkr) maintained by us. Together, these complete the key generation and key refreshing protocol. From here, we implement the pre-signing and signing protocols outlined in the aforementioned CGGMP paper. This implementation leverages the infrastructure built by Zengo, namely [round-based-protocol](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/round-based-protocol). We detail how this can be used in a blockchain's gossip network environment such as Substrate, as that motivates this work.

## Prerequisites

This guide uses <https://rustup.rs> installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable and nightly versions:

```bash
rustup update
rustup update nightly
```

Great! Now your Rust environment is ready! ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Installation ðŸ’»

Once the development environment is set up, build the repo. This command will build the MPC protocol:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

> NOTE: You _do not need_ to use the release builds! Debug builds can work here as well.

<h2 style="border-bottom:none"> Quick Start âš¡ </h2>

Check out the tests for examples on how to utilise the library!

<h3 id="substrate-integration"> Integration into Substrate </h3>

A main motivation for Webb is integrating this protocol into a blockchain environment such as Substrate. Our intention is to leverage both a blockchain's proof of stake / proof of authority selection mechanism as well as the underlying system's gossip network to bootstrap and execute this multi-party computation offchain. Throughout the lifecycle of the protocol, the participating MPC authorities will post data on-chain to keep the system in sync, such as to select the participating authorities, to govern the thresholds `t` and `n` and more.

An example of how this is possible using the same primitives provided in this repo can be found in our [dkg-substrate](https://github.com/webb-tools/dkg-substrate) repo. Currently the GG20 protocol is being executed. There are wrappers in place for executing any protocol using the [round-based-protocol](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/round-based-protocol) architecture. Slight modifications might be necessary and we aim to have this repo integrated into Substrate once it is working and tested here.

<h3 id="external-networking"> External Networking </h3>

Not included in this library is a server-oriented execution protocol. There are examples of how this can be done using GG20 in [multi-party-ecdas](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/multi-party-ecdsa/tree/master/examples). We welcome contributions to add a similar example here, but at the moment it will not be prioritized.

There are a variety of other external networking options one can choose between such as point-to-point channels, gossip networks, and or gRPC server coordinators. Each has different trade-offs. Point-to-point channels and gRPC server coordination allow one to run this protocol in the most simple manner, since the network topology is effectively decided on startup. In a gossip network environment this isn't always the case, therefore gossiping and re-gossiping messages using a method such as [gossipsub](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md) from [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) is recommended.

<h2 id="test"> Testing ðŸ§ª </h2>

The following instructions outlines how to run dkg-substrate's base test suite and E2E test suite.

### To run base tests

```
cargo test
```
